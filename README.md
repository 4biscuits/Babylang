# BabyLang
  Putting my own spin on some of my favorite estoeric languages brainf*ck and Cow, I came up with the grand BabyLang with 10 amazing opcodes. Interpreter is written in C++ (Cause, Why the hell not?). It  does not involve any complicated compiler design techniques or FAFL. It is basic, cause I am basic and the basic is the best. It is esoteric for a reason. If this sucks let me know, but that just makes you mean.
